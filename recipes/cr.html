    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A California roll is a fresh take on traditional Japanese rice rolls.
      Filled with avocado, crab, and cucumber, it's fresh and crunchy and makes
      a filling meal. You can use real or imitation crab.

      <li>2 cups of uncooked white rice</li>
      <li>1/2 cup of seasoned rice vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tsp of white sugar</li>
      <li>1 tsp of salt</li>
      <li>1/4 lb of cooked crab meat, drained of excess liquid and shredded</li>
      <li>1 tbsp of mayonnaise</li>
      <li>5 sheets of nori</li>
      <li>1 avocado, sliced</li>
      <li>1/4 cup of red caviar, ex: tobiko</li>
      <li>1 English cucumber, seeded and sliced into strips</li>
      <li>2 tbsp of drained pickled ginger</li>
      <li>2 tbsp of soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tbsp of wasabi paste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Wrap a sushi rolling mat completely in plastic wrap and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat
        to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has
        been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer rice to a bowl and cut in
        vinegar using a rice paddle or wooden spoon. Season with sugar and salt.
        Allow to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Combine crab meat with mayonnaise in a small bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Place nori sheet on a flat work surface. Spread a thin layer of rice on
        top of nori.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place nori, rice side down, on the prepared rolling mat. Place 2 to 3
        avocado slices on top of the nori in one layer.
      </li>
      <li>Top with 2 to 3 tablespoons of the crab mixture.</li>
      <li>
        Spoon 1 to 2 teaspoons tobiko lengthwise on one side of the avocado-crab
        mixture, and 2 cucumber strips on the other side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using the mat as a guide, carefully roll the California roll into a
        tight log. Remove the rolling mat. Top roll with more tobiko, cover with
        plastic wrap, and gently press the tobiko into the top of the roll.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the plastic and cut into 6 even pieces using a wet knife. Repeat
        with remaining sheets of nori and filling. Serve garnished with pickled
        ginger, soy sauce, and wasabi paste.
      </li>
    </ol>
